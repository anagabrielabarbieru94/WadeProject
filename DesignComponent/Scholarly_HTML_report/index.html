        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
                Towas (Tourist Web Assistant) is a responsive multi-device application developed for persons who likes to plan everything about trips or holydays.	It may be found usefull in situation like a person is stuck in an foreign location and needs food, accomodation or maybe he needs to have some fun somewhere. The application is available in multiple languages and it is capable to recommend places depending the user needs, based on the historical experience of the user correlated with semantic web technologies.<br>
                Towas follows Microservices Oriented Achitecture and uses Java Spring Boot as base technology. It also use SparQL interrogation language to provide information about locations, places, touristic objective, restaurants or hotels.

        <h3>Microservices Oriented Architecture </h3>
        Microservices are the main development technique used in this application. It is a variant of service oriented architecture(SOA) style, which gives to the application loosely coupled services and fine-grained. This is very useful because decomposing the application into different smaller services, it improves modularity.This aspect helps to parallelize development, and makes the application resilient to architecture eroison. A service in Microservices Architecture (MSA) can be seen like a process that communicates over a network with other services in order to fulfill a goal using an interoperable protocol like HTTP, is independently deployable and autonomously developed and should be well organized around capabilities.<br><br>
        In this application we use five microservices, all of them registered into Eureka Registration-Service, and discovered by a Gateway-Service Zuul throught all request are sent to each microservices.
        <li>
        	<p> 
        		<strong>AccountService<br></strong>
        		This service offers the possibility for a user to login on the application, search for last holidays planned,or for a new user to register on application and store some history information related to the past holidays. These informations can be useful in order to plan a new itinerary, based on past experience of our user. Al these informations are stored in a <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> database.
        	</p>
        </li>

        <li>
        	<p>
        		<strong>Itinerary Service<br></strong>
        		This is the most important service in our application. It offers the possibility to find routes, accomodations, restaurants, touristic objectives or activities depending on some aspects asked by the client like: destination, type of the trip, start and end date, and some information from user profile like interests, user's history. This microservice will communicate with AccountService in order to get the profile of the user, and will offer recommendations using SparQL queries to a GraphDB endpoint.
        	</p>	
        </li>

	<section id="Application Data Storage">
		<h3>Application Data Storage</h3>
		<strong>Tourist Web Assistant</strong> uses two ways of storing data. On the one hand, it uses a classical MySQL database table for user's personal information: username, password, e-mail, prefferences, itinerary history. On the other hand, the rest of the information provided by application's microservices are offered by a SparQL endpoint containing entities like: touristic objective, accomodation, restaurant, activity, route and itinerary. All of them are saved in a graph and correlated with other entities.

        <p> In the design phase, our planned RDF graph schema looked like this: </p>

        <p> At this moment, we have the following configuration (classes and relations): </p>

    <section id="Application development">
        <p> After the design phase that was presented for the previous project component, the effective application development has followed the next steps: 
        </p>

        <li>    
            <strong>Ontology development</strong>
            <p>This was one of the defining parts of the project development, because it have assumed the modelling of our toWas knowledge base. This is including entities such as countries, cities, accomodations, restaurants, different touristic objectives and relations between them created using a "Towas" vocabulary, which is be constructed over the existent vocabularies. 

            First step was defining our classes and properties, and then we populated a GraphDB endpoint with the specific instances.
            </p>

            <figure typeof = "sa:Image"> 
            <img src="public/resources/rdf_classes.PNG">
            <figcaption>

                </center>
            </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
            For the population procedure, the main datasources used were <a href="https://wiki.dbpedia.org/about">DBPedia</a> and <a href="https://www.geonames.org/">Geonames</a>. Firstly, we have extracted via DBPedia SparQL quieries some touristic significant countries and inserted them in our triple store. Then for each country, we have selected via Geonames web API the most important cities, and we have done in the same way with the hotels, restaurants and touristic objectives from the proximity of every city. Using the properties declared earlier, we made a separation between the entities within a city and those from its surrounding area, in order to give better suggestions for users.
            </p>

            <figure typeof = "sa:Image"> 
            <img src="public/resources/statements.PNG">
            <figcaption>
                <center>

                </center>
            </figcaption>
            </figure>
     
        <li>
            <strong>Microservices development</strong>
            <p>As we mentioned earlier, the application is separated into 2 individual microservices.</p>
            <li>
                The Account Service plays the role of user registration and authentification, and also keeps a tracking of his itineraries.
            </li>

            <li>
                The most important service is the itinerary service that stands as travel assistant for the user. It is exposed as RESTFul API, providing methods that in fact allows the user to find travel suggestions and make his own itineraries.

                Behind these methods implementations, the app is communicating with the toWas triple store populated earlier via SparQL queries, to get specific information.

                For example, for the path "/showCountries", the services makes a query to obtain all Country instances from the triple store.

                There are some basic queries for interrogating the several different entities from and in the proximity of a certain city that the user wants to visit, the service making available GET methods for any type of instance (accomodation, restaurant, museum etc).

                <figure typeof = "sa:Image"> 
                <img src="public/resources/theater_query.PNG">
                <figcaption>
                    <center>
                        Query that retrives the theaters in proximity of a certain city.
                    </center>
                </figcaption>
                </figure>

                A more complex SparQL query is based on the user preferences about some traveling specific activities that are also stored in the triple store. Each activity is related to a specific type of touristic objective. For example, it is clear that you can do skiing or hiking only in a mountain area or you can see an exhibition in a museum.
                Having the user favourite country and activities, the service queries the endpoint to retrieve all the cities from that country that contains touristic objectives related with these.
                This query can be seen below:

                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Adviser service</strong>
                <p>This is a service that has planned in the design phase, but we haven't manage to integrate it. Based on the user coordinates (GPS localisation), this service was supposed to make suggestions with accomodations, restaurants and objectives from his proximity. Regarding this, having the coordinates, at this moment we managed to write a query to find out the nearest towns. The query and results shown below. </p>

    	<h3>Conclusions</h3>
    	<p>
    	TOWAS (Tourist Web Assitant) is an application destinated for those people who like traveling and need fast and dynamic information about their desired location to be visited based on semantic web technologies. The application uses the experience, saving the user previous itineraries. The app could be improved with an adviser service (previously mentioned in the design component), which could give him suggestions of accomodations, restaurants and others, based on the current user geographic position (logitude and latitude) - GPS integration. Also, it can be improved with a machine learning based mechanism in order to recognize a specific profile of the user and offer recommendations based on these information too.
