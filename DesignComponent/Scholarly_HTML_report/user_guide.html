    <h2>Use Cases</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>The user is "traditionally" greeted by a <strong>login page</strong>, where he/she is supposed to enter his/her credentials (an username and a password) in order to be allowed to plan a new trip or to see his previous itinieraries planned with toWas.
            </p>

            <figure typeof = "sa:Image">

                </center>
            </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p> Once he enters the right credentials, the user will be further redirected. If not, he/she will ramain on the login page. </p>
            
            <figure typeof = "sa:Image">

            </figcaption>
            </figure>
        </li>
       
        <li>  
            <p> If the login is successful, the user is further redirected to the <strong>countries page</strong>. Here there are shown a list with available countries for travelling and also a description for each country. 

            <figure typeof = "sa:Image"> 
            <img src="public/resources/countries_1.PNG">

            </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p> In fact, these countries are stored behind in our triple store and they are retrived by a GET method through a SparQL query. </p> 

            <figure typeof = "sa:Image"> 
            <img src="public/resources/countries_2.PNG">

            </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                In order to go further, the user is supposed to chose one of the activities shown in the scrollbar from the top of the page in which he is interested in and choose the country he wants to travel be pressing corresponding the red button. 
            </p>

            <figure typeof = "sa:Image"> 
            <img src="public/resources/activities.PNG">

            </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p> Let's suppose we select the Sightseeing activity and want to go to Italy. </p>

            <figure typeof = "sa:Image"> 
            <img src="public/resources/choose_button.PNG">
            <figcaption>

                    Choosing Italy

            </figcaption>
            </figure>

        </li>

        <li>
            <p> After selecting our favorite activity and clicking on the choose button, the user is redirected to the <strong>localities page</strong>. Simmilar to the previous one, this page is displaying to the user a list of populated places (cities) from the country he has already chosen, places that are also related with the activity he has selected. </p>

            <figure typeof = "sa:Image">

            </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p> To be more specific, if we chose Sightseeing as activity, it is clear that this is related to a place which have museums and other cultural attractions such as monuments or castels. So the localities page will display for our user those Italy localities which have in their proximity cultural touristic objectives. </p>

            </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p> Again, by pressing the blue choose button corresponding for a certain place, we assume the user wants to make an itinerary to that place. Let's suppose we choose to go to Turin.
            </p>

        </li>

        <li>
            <p> After selecting his desired city, the user is greeted by a new page that is showing him various types of touristics objectives (cultural and natural), restaurants where he/she can have a lunch and accomodations to spend his nights, from the selected locality. </p>

            </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p> The user has at his disposal some check box buttons, in order to chose those objectives he plannes to visit in his itinerary. Also, at the top of the page he has a field to complete a name for his itinerary. </p>

            </figure>

            <p> After completing the name and selecting his favorite attraction, the user can go to th button of the page and click the red save button. Through this option, the user can save his itinerary and review it later. </p>

    	<h3>Conclusions</h3>
    	<p>
    	TOWAS (Tourist Web Assitant) is an application destinated for those people who like traveling and need fast and dynamic information about their desired location to be visited based on semantic web technologies. The application uses the experience, saving the user previous itineraries. The app could be improved with an adviser service (previously mentioned in the design component), which could give him suggestions of accomodations, restaurants and others, based on the current user geographic position (logitude and latitude) - GPS integration. Also, it can be improved with a machine learning based mechanism in order to recognize a specific profile of the user and offer recommendations based on these information too.
